### Solution to ROSALIND Bioinformatics Problems

##### Problem 1 - Reverse Compliment of DNA strand

##### Problem 2 - Calculation of GC Content

##### Problem 3 - Calculating Hamming distance between two strings s and t dH(s,t)

##### Problem 4 - Converting RNA to Protein using a codon table

##### Problem 5 - Calculating Protein mass using a protein mass table

##### Problem 6 - Finding Motifs in DNA. 
> Substring search within a string of DNA, returning index position of the motif

##### Problem 7 - Locating Restriction sites. 
> Finding reverse palindrome by checking if the DNA string is equal to its reverse complement. A palindrome can occur in lengths of 4 and 12 and can occur in multiple positions. 

##### Problem 8 - Rabbits and Recurrence Relations. 
> Using a recursive program and Fibonacci sequence.
